<p class="i4">(As was my undertaking.)</p>
<p class="i0">That I've a spirit wholly given to scorn,</p>

<p class="i0">He who erewhile about the ball-room stood</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Wondrous!" I cried. "The youngster's cheeks flush red,</p>

<p class="i4">The dread and the disgustful."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Shadow!" I said, "Civilisation fails,</p>
<p class="i0">While surfeits Idleness, and Labour pales.</p>
<p class="i4">For all its spread and glitter,</p>
<p class="i0">The Titan City lacks its crowning grace</p>
<p class="i0">And glory, whilst its pleasure is so base,</p>
<p class="i4">Its bondage is so bitter."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"True!" sighed the Shadow, and a softened smile</p>
<p class="i0">Seemed to illume the coldness, void of guile,</p>
<p class="i4">Of those phantasmal features.</p>
<p class="i0">"When from the City's gloom shall flash to light</p>
<p class="i0">This truth: The sleek and selfish sybarite</p>
<p class="i4">Is meanest of God's creatures?"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Shadow!" I cried. But in the darkness dim</p>
<p class="i0">Those lineaments did waver and dislimn</p>
<p class="i4">Like clouds at the sun's waking.</p>
<p class="i0">Alone I stood; fled was the night, the dream,</p>
<p class="i0">And o'er the sleeping City's sullen stream</p>
<p class="i4">Babylon's grey dawn was breaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Diag-nose-is of Wine.</span>&mdash;The Case of Champagne set before Mr. Alderman
and Sheriff <span class="smcap">Davies</span>. Of course, the worthy Alderman, who is a judge of
wine, needed only to raise the glass to his nose. He smelt it to see if
it was Corke'd. But in answer to the charge of false labelling, it
should have been simply pleaded that, at the manufactory, the labels
were not simply put on, but Clapt-on. Whether this defence would have
gone to mitigate the fine of twenty pounds, is another matter. The
Alderman's decision was given, much as the public generally pay for
Champagne,&mdash;good or bad,&mdash;that is, "through the nose."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Time to the eager seems to lag,</p>

<h2>ALL FOR THE SAKE OF THE ARMY!</h2>

<center><i>From Mr. C. Bounder to Mr. T. Tenterfive.</i></center>

<p>Dear Tommy,&mdash;I say, can't you give me a leg up, to get the Government to
adopt my confounded pop-guns? The foreigners don't seem to see them
much, and, hang it all! a true-hearted Johnnie should give his native
land the first chance.</p>

<p class="regards">Thine ever,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Charles Bounder</span>.</p>

<center><i>From Mr. T. Tenterfive to Mr. C. Bounder.</i></center>

<p>Dear Charley,&mdash;I'm afraid I'm not of much use. Send in application about
your pop-guns, and I will look after it as much as can. You mustn't
expect much, as the Department has a way of knocking a thing about for
months&mdash;sometimes years&mdash;and then quietly shelving it. Hope to see you
soon.</p>

<p class="regards">Thine ever,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Thomas Tenterfive</span>.</p>

<center><i>Report of Ordnance Committee, to be forwarded to the Adjutant-General.</i></center>

<p>We have examined the Bounder Patent Ironclad Pocket Revolving
Cannonette, and consider it a weapon that might possibly be introduced
into the Service with advantage, if the cost of production is not
excessive.</p>

<center><i>Report of Adjutant-General, to be forwarded to Quartermaster-General.</i></center>

<p>I enclose report of Ordnance Committee of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> which I approve. However, as
the matter involves a financial question, your opinion thereon would be
of great value.</p>

<center><i>Report of the Quartermaster-Gen., to be forwarded to Inspector-Gen. of
Fortifications.</i></center>

<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> offer no suggestion about the cost of production until it can be
ascertained whether the Cannonette will be suitable for Home Defences.
What is your opinion on this point?</p>

<center><i>Report of Inspector-General of Fortifications, to be forwarded to
Secretary of State.</i></center>

<p>No doubt the Cannonette might be used in a variety of ways. But it will
be observed that the Ordnance Committee raised the question of
expense&mdash;a matter that scarcely concerns my Department.</p>

<center><i>Memo. of Secretary of State, to be forwarded to Financial Secretary.</i></center>

<p><span class="smcap">Please</span> read inclosed Report, and send on.</p>

<center><i>Report of Financial Secretary, to be forwarded to the Director-General
of Ordnance.</i></center>

<p>It is premature to consider the question of expense until it has been
decided that the introduction of this Cannonette will be of advantage to
the Service. The Ordnance Committee use the words, "Might possibly,"
which are not, in themselves, a strong recommendation. It must be borne
in mind that the Army Estimates must be calculated with the greatest
attention to economy.</p>

<center><i>Report of Director-General of Ordnance to Commander-in-Chief.</i></center>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> examined Cannonette, which appears to have been constructed on
the lines of a weapon manufactured in the reign of <span class="smcap">Henry the Eighth</span>, of
which there is a specimen in the Museum at Woolwich.</p>

<p><i>Endorsement of Commander-in-Chief. (Packet to be put in Pigeon-hole</i>
404,567 B.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Possibly</span> something in the notion&mdash;immediate attention unnecessary.</p>

<center><i>From Mr. T. Tenterfive to Mr. C. Bounder.</i></center>

<p>Dear Charley,&mdash;Have just been looking through our papers relative to
your pop-gun. I am afraid you will have to wait for a decision a good
long while.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER OF ROBERT'S XSTRORNERRY ADWENCHURS.</h2>

<p>It was ony the beginnin of larst week, as I was a seekin to begile my
rayther tiresum lezzure by a wark down Cornhill&mdash;tho which is hup and
which is down that rayther strait hill it is sumtimes difficult to
say&mdash;that jest as I was a passing by the, to me, amost sacred
establishment of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Bring and Rhymer</span>, the great Cooks, as amost
everybody knos and reweres, I seed a henwellop a laying on the
pavement, which I naterally picked up, and put in my pocket quietly, and
then, crossing over to the Royal Xchange, jest hoppersit, I sets down on
one of the forms kindly purwided by the generus Copperashun and the
Mersers Company, six of one, and arf a dozzen of the other, for the rest
of the weary traveller.</p>

<p>Then I quietly hopened my henwellop&mdash;which, strange to say, hadn't no
name on it&mdash;and hinside it I found a check for twenty-five pounds! It
was payable to "No. 2,437, or Bearer." I was that estonished that I
amost thort I shoud have feinted, the more so as won of the Beedles was
a looking at me rayther pointedly, as I thort, tho I dessay it was ony
my gilty conshence, which, as sumboddy says, makes cowards of ewen Hed
Waiters, as well as all the rest of us. So I quietly put my henwellop
with its corstly contents into my pocket, and quietly warked away bang
into the Bank as was printed in the check, and there I hands it to the
Clark at the Counter as bold as brass. Well, he jest looks at it, and
then he says, "How will you take it,&mdash;short?" So I larfs, and I says, "I
shood like it all, please." Then he larfs, and he says, "Gold or Notes?"
So I says, "Sum of each, please, in a little bag." So he gave it me, and
then, I so astonishes his week nerves by what I next said, that he
turned amost pail. "I now wants you," I sed, "to send one of your yung
gennelmen with me to the Firm as drawed that check; for it isn't reelly
mine, for I ony found it!" So he did, as it was ony a little ways off;
and there, sure enuff, was too most respectful looking Gents in a
counting-'ouse a counting out their money, like the King in the Fairy
Tail.</p>

<p>"Well, my good man, and what do you want?" one of 'em said to me. So I
told 'em, and at the close of my story emtied out all the contents of my
little bag to the werry uttermost harf sovverain. "And, who is this
gennelman?" they said. "Oh," said I, "he is the Clark from the Bank cum
for to see that I acted on the square." "Well, you needn't wait any
longer," they said to him; so off he went.</p>

<p>So the elder one, he says to me, what is your name? <span class="smcap">Robert</span>," I
naterally replied, and amost xpected he was a going to arsk me, "who
gave me that name," but he didn't. So he larfed, and he said, "But there
are so many of that name about, that you must tell me somethink more."
So I plucked up my curridge, and I says, boldly, "Please, Gennelmen, I
am <span class="smcap">Robert</span> the City Waiter!" Well, I thinks as I never seed such a change
as cum over them too highly respectabel City Gents! They larfed quite
out loud, and they both got up and shook hands with me, and then they
larfed again, and then one on 'em said, what a lucky thing it was that
their lost check had fallen into sich honnest hands! Ah, what a grand
thing is a good karacter!&mdash;it's even better than reel Turtel and
Madeary!</p>

<p>They then made me set down, and they larfed, and they chatted away, and
arsked me lots of questions, all about my warious experiences, and the
young one arsked me if I rememberd the dinner at the Manshun 'Ouse, when
he asked me for sum more champane, saying, "I 'spose it is <i>had lib</i>?"
To which, he said, I replied, "Suttenly not! you can have as much as you
like!" And then they both larfed again quite hartily, tho' I'm sure I
coudn't see what there was to larf at.</p>

<p>They then arsked me jest to step out for a minnit or two, and when they
called me in they told me how pleased they was with my conduck, and, if
not offending me, they begged my acceptnse of a trifle, which shall be
nameless, but which made that memmurable day about the most
proffitablest I ewer remember.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S MORAL MUSIC-HALL DRAMAS.</h2>

<center>No. VII.-RECLAIMED! (<span class="smcap">Concluded.</span>)</center>

<blockquote><p>[Our readers will doubtless recollect the thrilling situation upon
which we were forced to drop the curtain. Lady <span class="smcap">Belledame</span>, the
hardened Grandmother of Little <span class="smcap">Elfie</span>, has, under the influence of
that angel-child, just vowed to amend, when, in the person of her
minion, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, she is reminded of the series of atrocious crimes
she had been contemplating through his instrumentality. Struck with
remorse, she attempts to countermand them&mdash;only to find that her
orders have already been executed with a too punctual fidelity! Now
we can go on.]</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>in a hoarse whisper</i>). You&mdash;you have left the parcels ...
all&mdash;<i>all</i>? Tell me&mdash;how were they received? Speak low&mdash;I would not that
yonder child should awake and hear!</p>

<p><i>Little Elfie</i> (<i>behind the screen, very wide awake indeed</i>). Dear, good
old Grannie&mdash;she would conceal her generosity&mdash;even from <i>me</i>!
(<i>Loudly.</i>) She little thinks that I am overhearing all!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> I could have sworn I heard whispering.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Nay, you are mistaken&mdash;'twas but the wind in the old wainscot.
(<i>Aside.</i>) He is quite capable of destroying that innocent child; but,
old and attached servant as he is, there are liberties I still know how
to forbid. (<i>To</i> M.) Your story&mdash;quick!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> First, I delivered the cigars to Sir <span class="smcap">Vevey Long</span>, whom I found
under his verandah. He seemed surprised and gratified by the gift,
selected a weed, and was proceeding to light it, whilst he showed a
desire to converse familiarly with me. 'Astily excusing myself, I drove
away, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> When <i>what</i>? Do not torture a wretched old woman!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> When I heard a loud report behind me, and, in the portion of a
brace, two waistcoat-buttons, and half a slipper, which hurtled past my
ears, I recognised all that was mortal of the late Sir <span class="smcap">Vevey</span>. You mixed
them cigars uncommon strong, m'Lady.</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>aside</i>). Can it be? But no, no. I will <i>not</i> believe it. I am
sure that dear Granny meant no harm!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>with a grim pride she cannot wholly repress</i>). I have
devoted some study to the subject of explosives. 'Tis another triumph to
the Anti-tobacconists. And what of Lady <span class="smcap">Violet Powdray</span>&mdash;did she apply
the salve?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Judging from the 'eartrending 'owls which proceeded from
Carmine Cottage, the salve was producing the desired result. Her
Ladyship, 'owever, terminated her sufferings somewhat prematoor by
jumping out of a top winder just as I was taking my departure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> She should have died hereafter&mdash;but no matter ... and the
Upas-tree?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Was presented to the <span class="smcap">Pergaments</span>, who unpacked it, and loaded
its branches with toys and tapers; after which Mr. <span class="smcap">Pergaments</span>, Mrs. P.,
and all the little <span class="smcap">Pergaments</span> joined 'ands, and danced round it in light
'arted glee. (<i>In a sombre tone.</i>) They little knoo as how it was their
dance of death!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> That knowledge will come! And the beer, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>&mdash;you saw it
broached?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Upon the village green; the mortality is still spreading, it
being found impossible to undo the knots in which the victims had tied
themselves. The sweetmeats were likewise distributed, and the floor of
the hinfant-school now resembles one vast fly-paper.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>with a touch of remorse</i>). The children, too! Was not my
little <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> once an infant? Ah me, ah me!</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>aside</i>). Once&mdash;but that was long, long ago. And, oh, <i>how</i>
disappointed I am in poor dear Grandmamma!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, you should not have done these things&mdash;you should
have saved me from myself. You <i>must</i> have known how greatly all this
would increase my unpopularity in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). And this is my reward for obeying orders! Take
care, my Lady. It suits you now to throw me aside like a&mdash;(<i>casting
about for an original simile</i>)&mdash;like a old glove, because this innocent
grandchild of yours has touched your flinty 'art. But where will <i>you</i>
be when she learns&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>in agony</i>). Ah, no, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, good, faithful <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, she
must never know that! Think, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, you would not tell her that the
Grandmother to whom she looks up with such touching, childlike love, was
a&mdash;<i>homicide</i>&mdash;you would not do that?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Some would say even 'omicide was not too black a name for all
you've done. (Lady <span class="smcap">Belledame</span> <i>shudders</i>.) I might tell Miss <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> how
you've blowed up a live Baronet, corrosive sublimated a gentle Lady,
honly for 'aving, in a moment of candour, called you a hold cat, and
distributed pison in a variety of forms about this smiling village; and,
if that don't inspire her with distrust, I don't know the nature of
children, that's all! I might tell her, I say, and, if I'm to keep my
mouth shut, I shall expect it to be considered in my wages.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> I knew you had a good heart! I will pay you
anything&mdash;anything, provided you shield my guilt from her ... wait, you
shall have gold, gold, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, gold!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Chord. Little</i> <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> <i>suddenly comes from behind screen; limelight on
her. The other two shrink back.</i></p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> Do not give that bad old man money, Grandmother,&mdash;for it will
only be wasted.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Speak, child&mdash;how much do you know?</p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> All!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Chord.</i> Lady B. <i>collapses on chair.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>with an effort</i>). And now, <span class="smcap">Elfie</span>, that you know, you scorn
and hate your poor old Grandmother&mdash;is it not so?</p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> It is wrong to hate one's Grandmother, whatever she does. At
first, when I heard, I was very, very sorry. I <i>did</i> think it was most
unkind of you. But now, oh, I <i>can't</i> believe that you had not some
good, wise motive, in acting as you did!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>in conscience-stricken aside</i>). Even <i>this</i> cannot shatter
her artless faith ... Oh, wretch, wretch!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Covers her face.</i></p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Motive&mdash;I believe you there, Missie. Why, she went and insured
all their lives aforehand, <i>she</i> did.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, in pity hold your peace!</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>her face beaming</i>). I knew it&mdash;I was sure of it! Oh, Granny,
my dear, kind old Granny, you insured their lives first, so that no real
harm could possibly happen to them&mdash;oh, I am so happy!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>aside</i>). What shall I say? Merciful Powers, what <i>shall</i> I
say to her?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Disturbed sounds without.</i></p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> I don't know what you'd better <i>say</i>, but I can tell you what
your Ladyship had better <i>do</i>&mdash;and that is, take your 'ook while you
can. Even now the outraged populace approaches, to wreak a hawful
vengeance upon your guilty 'ed!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Melodramatic music.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>distractedly</i>). A mob! I cannot face them&mdash;they will tear me
limb from limb. At my age I could not survive such an indignity as that!
Hide me, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>&mdash;help me to escape!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> There is a secret underground passage, known only to myself,
communicating with the nearest railway station. I will point it out, and
personally conduct your Ladyship&mdash;for a consideration&mdash;one thousand
pounds down.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The noise increases.</i></p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> No, Grannie, don't trust him! Be calm and brave. Await the mob
here. Leave it all to me. I will explain everything to them&mdash;how you
meant no ill,&mdash;how, at the very time they thought you were meditating an
injury, you were actually spending money in insuring all their lives.
When I tell them <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Ah, you tell 'em that, and see. It's too late now&mdash;they are
here.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Shouts without. Lady B. crouches on floor. Little</i> <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> <i>goes to the
window, throws open the shutters, and stands on balcony in her
fluttering white robe, and the limelight.</i></p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> Yes, they are here. Why, they are carrying torches!&mdash;(Lady <span class="smcap">B</span>.
<i>groans</i>)&mdash;and banners, too! I think they have a band ... Who is that
tall, stout gentleman, in the white hat, on horseback, and the lady in a
pony-trap, with, oh, such a beautiful complexion! There is an
inscription on one of the flags&mdash;I can read it quite plainly. "<i>Thanks
to the generous Donor!</i>" (That must be <i>you</i>, Grandmother!) And there
are children who dance, and scatter flowers. They are asking for a
speech. (<i>Speaking off.</i>) "If you please, Ladies and Gentlemen, my
Grandmamma is not at all well, but she wishes me to say she wishes you a
Merry Christmas, and is very glad you all like your presents so much.
Good-bye, <i>good</i>-bye! (<i>Returning down Stage.</i>) Now they have gone away,
Granny ... They did look so grateful!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>bewildered</i>). What is this? Sir <span class="smcap">Vevey</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Violet</span>,&mdash;alive,
well? This deputation of gratitude? Am I mad, dreaming&mdash;or what does it
all mean?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> (<i>doggedly</i>). It means that the sight of this 'ere angel-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>child
recalled me to a sense of what I might be exposin' myself to by carrying
out your Ladyship's commands; and so I took the liberty of substitootin
gifts more calculated to inspire gratitude in their recipients&mdash;that's
what it means.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> Wretch!&mdash;then you have disobeyed me? You leave this day month!</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>pleading</i>). Nay, Grandmother, bear with him, for has not his
disobedience spared you from acts that you might some day have
regretted?... There, Mr. Butler, Granny forgives you&mdash;see, she holds out
her hand, and here's mine; and now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>smiling tenderly</i>). Now you shall sing us "<i>Woa, Lucinda!</i>"</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Little</i> <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> <i>fetches her banjo, and sings, "Woa, Lucinda!" her

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type-writer.</i>)</center>

<h4>No. II.&mdash;THE CORINTHIAN LADY.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/101.png">
<img src="images/101.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Corinthian Lady is the latest resultant of the two forces of <i>ennui</i>
and dissipation acting on a Society that is willing to spend money and
desires to kill time. She has played many parts, some (of infinitesimal
proportions), on the burlesque stage, others in the semi-private life of
her own residence in the South-west district of London. Her versatility
has gained for her many admirers and a precarious income, but so long as
she possesses the former she scorns to live upon the latter. Being
unquestionably a real lady, she has been elected an honorary member of a
night club to which undoubted gentlemen resort. There she occasionally
consents to dance; more often she sups to an accompaniment of Viennese
music, loud and mirthless laughter, jests which are as fatuous as they
are suggestive, and wine which, unlike the humour of the plated youths,
her companions, is always sparkling and sometimes dry.</p>

<p>Her real name is a mystery, which, however, she did not find attractive.
Having, therefore, abandoned it, she generally substitutes for it the
patronymic of a Norman peer, but, lest this should be thought too
strong, she dilutes it by the addition of a pet name drawn from the
nursery. By this title her fame is celebrated amongst many foolish young
men who singe themselves at the flame of her friendship, and many others
who, wishing to be thought wise, pretend to know her. Like all doves,
she plumes herself on her good looks. Unlike them, she is proud of her
bad habits; but she is a stern censor, and shows scant mercy to those
colleagues who, surpassing her in the former, lack means or chances to
attain to the splendour of the latter. Should one of these happen to be
admitted to a club she frequents, or to a supper-party she honours with
her presence, she has been known to wrap herself in her sealskins, and
to depart indignantly in her private brougham.</p>

<p>She possesses the secret of nocturnal youth, and her eyes are warranted
to kill across a supper-table, yet she is no longer young, and sometimes
betrays herself by her anecdotes of familiar associations with "boys"
who have long since passed into respectability and middle-age. Though
she adores diamonds, she frequently sells them, and includes in the
transaction those who have purchased them for her; yet she retains and
wears as many jewels as would furnish forth a Duchess in a <i>Bow Bells</i>
novel. But her elbow gloves, which rarely come within a measurable
distance of godliness, inevitably proclaim the Corinthian.</p>

<p>She is constant only in her love of excitement, and in her devotion to
change, whether it be of the persons of her adorers, or of the colour of
her hair. Having early in life learnt the lesson that only those who
possess are happy, she endeavours to assure herself against misery by
transferring to herself the wealth of those who fall under her
influence, or aspire to her affections. She apes what she conceives to
be the manners of good society by a languid affectation of refinement
and a supercilious drawl, yet she has been known to clothe herself in
objurgations as in a tea-gown, and to repel with scurrility the advances
of those who are not moneyed. She earns a certain popularity by the
display of a kind of rough good-nature, and the possession of a pet
poodle. She has been seen on a coach at Ascot, and in a launch at Henley
Regatta, together with a select company of those who cultivate
excitement by not looking at the exertions of horses or athletes, whilst
they themselves drink Champagne. Nor is she unknown in the boxes of the
Gaiety or the Avenue, whither she repairs after dining at the Caf&eacute;
Royal. She goes, but not alone, to Monte Carlo, and returns, under a
different escort, to London, after losing a great deal of the money of
other people.</p>

<p>She was once married to a racing man of shady reputation and great
wealth, but having soon wearied of the mock-respectability of a
quasi-matrimonial existence, she makes the acquaintance of Mr. Justice
<span class="smcap">Butt</span> at a moment when he is engaged neither upon the probate of wills
nor on the collisions of ships. Yet her dislike of one husband who
happened for a time to be her own has not in the least impaired her
affections for the husbands, actual or to be, of others. No lady can be
considered truly Corinthian unless she has figured as the defendant in
an action for goods supplied by a milliner. It is thus that the Public
learns the Corinthian value of silks, and satins, and laces, and
decorative butterflies.</p>

<p>Finally, however, in spite of her gallant and protracted struggles, the
years overtake her. She begins to be talked of with a pitying contempt
as "<span class="smcap">Old So-and-So</span>"; art ceases to outwit Nature, and she herself can no
longer deceive men. For some time she clings to the fringe of the
society she once adorned; but sinking gradually from the Corinthian to
the Continental, from the Continental to the Cavour, from the Cavour to
a supper-less Music-hall existence, and hence, after many misfortunes,
to the cold comfort of the pavement, she ends her days decrepit,
obscure, and unfriended, in the back bed-room of a Soho lodging.</p>

<h2>GHOSTLESS BOSTON.</h2>

<p class="i0">Are there no ghosts in New England? Really, this is something new.</p>

<p class="i0">Are the Katskills now unhaunted, where those silent elders bowled,</p>

<p class="i0">And a spectre is a nuisance when he gibbers on board ship.</p>
<p class="i0">So, no doubt, those sturdy people, when they crossed Atlantic foam,</p>
<p class="i0">From an economic motive, left their phantoms all at home.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">Ghosts have seen as good in days of stately dames and high-born men;</p>
<p class="i0">While a curious nasal accent, just a <i>soupcon</i> of a twang,</p>
<p class="i0">May cause spectres of refinement an involuntary pang.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">So it seems the phantoms shun it, be the reason what it may,</p>
<p class="i0">Not a single ghost of Boston owns to living there to-day.</p>
<p class="i0">Possibly, if we but knew it, an American's too spry,</p>
<p class="i0">And he takes his spirit with him when he condescends to die;</p>
<p class="i0">Any way the "spooks" have vanished, and the spectres of old time</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>My faithful "Co." has been reading <i>Marooned</i>, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark Russell</span>, an
author who delights in stories of nautical adventure. My worthy follower
declares that the novel, although rather spun out, is full of interest.
He was especially pleased with Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark Russell's</span> anxiety to make his
meaning clear when talking of things maritime. He particularly instances
a passage in Vol. II., page 17. Here it is: "It is proper I should state
here, for the information for those to whom sea-terms are
unintelligible, that a studding-sail-boom is a long smooth spar that
reeves through irons, fixed upon the yard to which it belongs." How
land-lubbers would be able to understand the marine technicalities Mr.
<span class="smcap">Russell</span> introduces into his stories without explanations such as this,
it would be difficult to say, but with such assistance, a
studding-sail-boom becomes as easy of identification as a marling-spike
lashed to a forecastle spinaker-boom, close hauled aport under trysails,
blowing out like flags from the grips of clew-lines and leech-lines
towards the close of a second dog-watch! Shiver <span class="smcap">Lindley Murray's</span>
timbers! but what can be finer than a bulkhead battened down with the
scandalised main-sail of a top-gallant clipper-rigged halliard! Ah, what
indeed!</p>

<p>"Co." has also been improving his mind by reading a new edition of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Joseph Foster's</span> <i>Noble and Gentle Families of Royal Descent</i>, in which
he has found, amongst other interesting matter, the recently much
discussed pedigree of the Duke of <span class="smcap">Fife</span>. Like all Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster's</span> books of
reference, the two handsome volumes are invaluable to the genealogist,
and no library can be accurately said to be <i>quite</i> complete without
them.</p>

<h2>LE KICK-BALLE FIGHT.</h2>

<p>It is with the feelings of <i>a 'Igh Life-Sporting-Gentlemans</i> most
ecstatic and profound, that I find myself preparing "<i>Le Onze</i>" of the
great spirited youths of our Lyc&eacute;e, who have, brave-souled heroes,
volunteered to meet on the <i>v&eacute;ritable champ de bataille</i> of the
kicke-legges-match your Public-school-team, who have thrown in their
faces the challenge glove of combat. I say, I am preparing, but this
means, of course, with such modifications of your <i>Jeu-de-Rugby</i> rules,
which, indeed, turn the struggle into <i>un vrai carnage</i>, degrading alike
to humanity and civilisation, as will permit the enlightened children of
our great, refined and Republican France, to meet their antagonists not
with the savage antics of Blood-thirsty Cannibals, which seem to
characterise what you term "<i>le scrimmage</i>," as practised by your
contending "<i>'ome-teams</i>" at <i>le Hovals</i> and other arenas, where meet
and rend each other with the fury unrestrained, terrible and
indescribable of the wild beasts and gladiators of the barbaric Roman
Circus, of ancient times, but with the humanised activity of that
expurgated and refined form of the contest which has enabled the
courageous but reasoning youth of this great reforming and Republic
France of ours, to throw open wide her arms and welcome to her heart
elastic and generous <i>Le Kick-Balle Fight</i>, as henceforth her own chosen
and peculiar national game.</p>

<p>You can understand, <i>Mon cher Monsieur</i>, that I cannot, in the short
space at my disposal in this limited letter, do more than merely outline
the suggestion of the New Rules, but when I assure you that they have
been cautiously thought out, drawn up and revised by a carefully
selected Committee, comprising, among other noted experts, a
Major-General of Engineers, two Analytical Chemists, a Balloon
Proprietor, an Archbishop, a Wild-beast Tamer, a Ballet Master, a
Professor of Anatomy, a Patent Artificial Limb Maker, and a Champion
Fighter of <i>Le Boxe Americain</i>, you will see that the features of the
game, gay, murderous, active, and terrible, have all been considered
with a due regard to their preservation where this has been found
compatible with the sacredness of human life and the protection of <i>le
shin</i> from too much furious and brutal bruising. But here I subjoin a
few of the simpler "New Provisions" as adopted by the Committee.</p>

<p>1. "Le Balle."&mdash;He will be constructed of Gold-beater's Skin, and
covered with Pink or Blue Satin, with perhaps a few White Silk Bows,
sewn on to him for the purpose of elegant adornment. It is this making
of "Le Balle," a light, gay, and altogether ethereal creation which will
strike the key-note of the new game of <i>Le Kick-Balle Fight</i> as a
recognised pastime for the courageous youth of modern France.</p>

<p>2. <i>Le Onze</i>, will all wear one uniform, which will consist of white
satin slippers, pantalons of cashmere, with feather pillows worn as a
protection strapped over the knees, a bolster being wound round the body
to safeguard the chest, ribs, and spinal column. A broad gay, coloured
satin sash with a cocked hat and ostrich feathers completes the costume.
The last to indicate, owing to the risks and dangers in which the
combatants may be involved, its association with <i>le vrai champs de
bataille</i>, to which, but for the "new provisions" it would bear such a
terrible and striking resemblance.</p>

<p>3. "Le 'Arf-back."&mdash;This dangerous officer is abolished altogether, the
Committee being of opinion, unanimous and decisive, that the position is
only provocative of strife.</p>

<p>4. "Le Forward."&mdash;He is for the same reason equally abolished, and in
the French game exists no more.</p>

<p>5. "Le Goal-keepere."&mdash;He may keep "Le Goal" if he can do so without
danger of being struck in the face with "Le Balle."</p>

<p>6. "Le Balle" must, on no account, be touched with the foot, but merely
slapped playfully, enough for the purposes of propulsion, with the palm
of the open hand.</p>

<p>7. "Le Scrimmage." This barbarous and savage entanglement is absolutely
<i>d&eacute;fendu</i>. No two opposing combatants must ever, under any
circumstances, permit themselves to touch each other. The great skill of
the new game will be, by subtle and appropriate gesticulation, to dance
out of each other's way. On any two opposing combatants, by any chance,
touching each other, "Le Capitaine" of either side will appeal to the
Umpire, and, after the manner of "Le jeu de Cricket," will propose for
him the simple question, "Mister Umpire, 'ow is that?" Upon which, that
official saying "Out!" the two offenders will be struck from the game,
and enjoy no share of "Le gate-money," if that is the prize for which
the two teams are honourably contending.</p>

<p>The above, <i>Mon cher Monsieur</i>, are the principal Rules, as arranged by
the Committee, and you will see that they have been drawn up with a view
to eliminating the bloodthirsty <i>boule-dogue</i> ferocity from a pastime
which, under the title of <i>Le Kick-Balle Fight</i>, bids fair to become the
characteristic sport, gay, active, and courage-inspiring, of our modern
French youth awakened with <i>&eacute;lan</i> and ardour to the athletic spirit of
the age which has overtaken them.</p>

<p class="regards">Receive, <i>Mon cher Monsieur</i>, the assurance of my most distinguished
consideration,</p>

<h2>THE FARTHING NOVEL SERIES.</h2>

<p>Now that the entire works of the late <span class="smcap">William Shakspeare</span> can be
purchased (allowing for discount) for fourpence-halfpenny, it seems
strange that no publisher has issued the more celebrated of our romances
at the rate per volume of the smallest coin of the realm. That it can be
done will be obvious to the meanest comprehension. All that is required
is brevity and intelligibility. It is only necessary to give an outline
of the story&mdash;the sketchier the better. If a little "local colouring"
can be thrown in, no harm will be done. But that local colouring must be
distinctly modern. Again, if sentiments calculated to be popular with
the class by whom the series is likely to be purchased are introduced, a
distinct gain will be the consequence. But as an example is better than
pages of description, a sample is subjoined:&mdash;</p>

<h3>IVANHOE;</h3>

<p><i>Or, The Disguised Knight, the Distressed Jewess, and the Templar who
did not Behave like a Gentleman.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h4>

<p>"You are very welcome," said <span class="smcap">Cedric</span> the Saxon, for the fifth time, as
Sir <span class="smcap">Brian de Bois-Gilbert</span> took down the Fair <span class="smcap">Rowena</span> to supper. "As for
you, <span class="smcap">Wilfrid</span> the Pilgrim, sit below the salt, and, Sir Seneschal, keep
your eyes upon the horn spoons."</p>

<p>"And this is the curse of the land," murmured the heir, as he helped
himself to plum-pasty, the forerunner of plum-pudding. "It is this
haughtiness that causes our yeomen to strike, and makes <span class="smcap">Robin Hood</span>,
Friar <span class="smcap">Tuck</span>, and the rest of his merry men possible!"</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h4>

<p>The next day joined in the tournament. It was a grand sight. The horses
pranced, the plumes flowed in the wind. The refreshments were executed
by contract, at so much a head, by a body of adventurers, who had
combined together to keep down prices.</p>

<p>"Nay, beshrew thee, man!" exclaimed <span class="smcap">John</span>, the Smith, to <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> the
Jones&mdash;a contraction of joiner. "It is these
combinations&mdash;co-operations, as Sir <span class="smcap">Evans</span>, the Clerk at the church over
yonder hath it&mdash;that ruin trade." Before <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> the Jones or joiner
could reply, there was a crash, and it was known that Sir <span class="smcap">Brian</span> had been
overcome by a Knight who had no crest.</p>

<p>"He does not deserve to win," said a Herald to a Pursuivant&mdash;"defrauding
us of our fees! No coat-of-arms; no pedigree! It is simply disgraceful."</p>

<p>"Ay, and so it is," replied the under-officers of the College of Arms.
"But see yonder is <span class="smcap">Isaac</span> of <span class="smcap">York</span> the Jew. Join me in a bond, and we will
avail ourselves of his usury." And within twenty-four hours the two
gentles had borrowed one-and-sevenpence-halfpenny!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h4>

<p>In the meanwhile Sir <span class="smcap">Brian</span> had carried off <span class="smcap">Rebecca</span>, been slain, and
disposed of.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h4>

<p>Then there was a magnificent wedding, as <span class="smcap">Wilfrid</span> of Ivanhoe, no longer
the disowned, but the heir to estates belonging to a highly respectable
county family led his bride to the altar.</p>

<p>"Methinks she takes the cake," whispered <span class="smcap">Wamba</span> the Jester.</p>

<p>"Not until after the breakfast," replied <span class="smcap">Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion</span>,
throwing off his disguise as the Nameless Knight, and appearing in the
full costume of a monarch.</p>

<p>"Long live the King!" shouted the populace.</p>

<p>"You are right to utter that wish," returned His Majesty, "so long as I
reign without attempting to govern. Believe me, it is better to have
universal suffrage than a despot who may be at once cruel and
incompetent."</p>

<p>"In fact, an idiot," put in a reporter, who was doing the ceremony for a
local record.</p>

<p>"Quite so," acquiesced the Monarch; and then, turning to the
newly-married pair, he observed, "Bless you, my children! Mark me, I
order you to live in happiness for ever afterwards."</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">Ivanhoe</span> and his bride obeyed the royal command.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 17.</i>&mdash;"Better be in your place
early," said <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>, passing me as he marched with long strides across
resounding corridor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. <span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> going to say what Government will do about
<span class="smcap">Parnell</span> Commission's Report; everybody anxious to know."</p>

<p>"It's not that, dear boy, not that," said our new Minister, in
compassionate tone. "I have two questions to answer. First time, don't
you know; everybody dying to see how it goes off; warrant you they
shan't be disappointed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobb</span> the Curious came on with first interrogatory. All about fox-hunting
and fox-hunters. Pretty to see <span class="smcap">Cobb</span>, having submitted his question under
ten sub-heads, place hands on knees and fix Minister with steady stare.
<span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> advanced to table with graceful carriage and confident bearing;
produced with imposing flourish a sheaf of notes, foolscap size, stoutly
sewn, apparently exceeding a dozen in number; began to read with
practised elocutionary art; drew the covert, "so to speak," as <span class="smcap">T. W.
Russell</span> protests he said when telling the men of Manchester that <span class="smcap">William
O'Brien</span> must be taken by the throat. No draw; went to next covert&mdash;I
mean turned over another folio. House began to murmur; <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>,
accepting involuntary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> applause, read on with increased impressiveness
and complacency; murmurs grew into shout. At view-halloa! fox started;
fifth folio now reached; only seven more to read. <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> began to wish
<span class="smcap">Goschen</span> or <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> would go and fetch him glass of water. Cries
from crowd grew louder. At last <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span>, looking up, beheld, through
astonished glasses, Opposition indulging in roar of contumely. Wouldn't
have taken him more than quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to finish
his few remarks, and yet a lot of miserable Members who didn't know a
fox from a hare wouldn't let him go on! Struggled gallantly for some
minutes; at last sat down; whole pages of his answer unrecited.</p>

<h4>The Inquiring Cobb.</h4>
</div>

<p>Speeches all night in continued Debate on the Address. <span class="smcap">Parnell</span> has moved
Amendment arraigning <span class="smcap">Balfour's</span> administration in Ireland. <span class="smcap">William
O'Brien</span>, chancing to be out of prison, looks in and delivers fiery
harangue in support of Amendment. But yesterday, <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, his gaoler;
ordered his food; not too much of it and not full variety; fixed his
hours of going to bed and getting up. Now prison-doors opened by lapse
of time; <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span> walks out through Westminster Hall into House of
Commons; stands before <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> on equal terms with his whilom gaoler,
and scolds him magnificently. By-and-by <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> will probably have his
turn again, and <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span> will be eating and drinking the bread and water
of affliction. Meanwhile, storms at top of his voice, beats the air with
long lean arm and clenched hand, and makes dumb dogs of English Members
sad with musing on the inequalities of fortune, which has given these
Irishmen the great gift of pointedly saying what they have at heart.</p>

<h4>The Cobden Club</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"Well," said <span class="smcap">Thomas Bayley Potter</span>, sinking slowly into
corner seat, grateful to find that <span class="smcap">Peter O'Brien</span> was his neighbour, for
<span class="smcap">Peter</span> finds it possible to pack himself into a limited space and <span class="smcap">Thomas
Bayley's</span> proportions are roomy&mdash;"well it <i>is</i> nice to see how these old
colleagues love one another. Come next April, I have sat in House man
and boy for twenty-five years. Have found that on some pretext, on one
occasion or another, they are always at it, scratching each other's
face, pulling one another's hair, or stabbing each other in the back.
Why don't they all join the Cobden Club, sink minor differences, and be
friends ever after?"</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Thomas Bayley</span> thus mused, he gazed across Gangway on to Front
Opposition Bench. An interesting incident developing. <span class="smcap">Henry James</span> on his
legs (generally on one) opposing <span class="smcap">Parnell's</span> Amendment to Address. He
stands between the outstretched legs of his two dear and right hon.
friends, <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> and <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>. Just beyond <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>, <span class="smcap">Trevelyan</span>
sits. At the other side of <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> towers, toying with the
gracious folds of his massive chin, looking straight before him with
sphynx-like gaze. According to etiquette and usage, <span class="smcap">James</span> should be
addressing the Chair; but his back is turned to <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>. He faces half
round to Front Opposition Bench, and, with left foot clasped round right
ankle, elbow of right arm leaning on box, and clenched left hand
swinging to and fro in perilous proximity to a grand old proboscis, he
literally drives home his argument. House may listen, if it pleases,
like crowd closing in on street squabble; <span class="smcap">Henry James</span> is having it out
with his old friends and Leader;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> professing fullest respect, and even
reverence for his right hon. friend the Member for Midlothian, but at
same time showing how utterly, hopelessly wrong he and his have gone
since his former Solicitor-General parted company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, a little out of it, sits and ponders, possibly thinking of the
days when he was plain Mr. <span class="smcap">Vernon Harcourt</span>, and, seated below the
Gangway, used to, in company with his young friend, Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, bait
<span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, then on Treasury Bench, hastening to the catastrophe of 1874.</p>

<p>"Makes me feel quite old," said <span class="smcap">Thomas Bayley Potter</span>, dexterously
appropriating another half-inch of the space that rightfully belonged to
<span class="smcap">Peter O'Brien</span>. "Seems but yesterday that <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> and <span class="smcap">James</span> were in the
running, one for Attorney-General, the other Solicitor-General. But
getting it, having got it, or having abandoned it, seems all to lead to
the same end&mdash;the worrying of the Grand Old Man."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Parnell's</span> Amendment to Address negatived by 307 Votes
against 240.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lycidas</span> is dead&mdash;dead in his prime! It was this very
morning, in the earliest moments of its birth, that I watched <span class="smcap">Joseph
Gillis</span> walking up the floor shoulder to shoulder with old friend <span class="smcap">Dick
Power</span>, "telling" in division on <span class="smcap">Parnell's</span> Amendment to Address. Beaten,
of course, but majority diminished, and <span class="smcap">Joey</span> beamed as he walked across
Lobby towards Cloak-Room. Rather a sickly beam, compared with wild
lights that used to flash from his eyes in the old times, when majority
against Home Rule was a great deal more than 67.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> a little tired, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, dear boy," he said. "These dull
sittings and early adjournments don't suit me. I was better and stronger
in the old times, when we used to sit up all night and fight all day.
Remember thirteen years ago, when I slept for an hour on two chairs in
the Library? Returned to House at five in morning; found them all
looking jaded and worn; cheered them up by saying I'd come back like a
giant refreshed. Well, I'll go home now, have a good sleep, be all right
in the morning."</p>

<p>And when we are gathered in House for Wednesday's sitting we learn that
all is right indeed, and that poor old <span class="smcap">Joey B.</span> lies quiet, with face
upturned, in his alien lodgings off Clapham Common.</p>

<p>He would be surprised if he knew with what warm and sincere feeling his
sudden taking-off is mourned. At the time he spoke of, thirteen years
back, he was certainly the most abhorred person on the premises, and
gleefully chuckled over consciousness of the fact. But the House, with
nearer knowledge, learned to recognise his sterling qualities, and now,
when Death rounds off with tragic touch the comicalities of his public
life, everyone has a kindly word to say for <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Address.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Curious," said <span class="smcap">Campbell-Bannerman</span>, "how habits ingrained
in early life, born in the blood as it were, come out at chance times.
Here's <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> been for a generation practically divorced from
business affairs in the Strand, and yet look at him now, and listen to
him!"</p>

<p>Strange transmogrification truly. Arose on question put by <span class="smcap">Hunter</span> as to
when the ten volumes of evidence, upon which Report of Special Committee
founded, would be on the bookstalls. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> at the table in a
moment, his manner brisk yet deferential, his hands involuntarily
wandering over the books and papers scattered about, as if he were
looking for special edition someone on other side of counter had asked
for.</p>

<p>"The Evidence," he said, "given before the Special Commission occupies
eleven volumes, consisting of the Evidence and Appendix, and they will
probably be followed by a twelfth volume containing Index matter. We
trust that the first eleven volumes will be ready for delivery to
customers before the 1st of March."</p>

<h4>District Councils.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter O'Brien</span>, not yet expanded since compressed by contiguity of <span class="smcap">Thomas
Bayley Potter</span>, asked whether complete copies of the evidence would be
supplied to other persons incriminated, but not being Members of the
House? <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> at the counter again; the old Adam in him stronger
than ever. Here was a pretty proposal! Bound to supply this interesting
work gratuitously to Members of Parliament; to go beyond that most
unbusinesslike.</p>

<p>"No, Sir," he said, firmly; "it is open to other persons to obtain the
volumes by purchase."</p>

<p>House roared with laughter, turned delighted from this little comedy to
face the gloomy prospect of <span class="smcap">Stansfeld</span> on District Councils.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Still harping on Address.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;"Strange," said <span class="smcap">J. A. Picton</span>, slowly rubbing his brawny
hands, "how in our ashes live our wonted fires."</p>

<p>Dwelt amongst dead ashes all week; dreary dulness. To-night, in very
last hour of week, Debate suddenly flashes forth in brilliant flame,
worthy of old traditions. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, with his back to the wall, faced
and flanked by jeering, scornful, angry Liberals. Explains why he's
going to vote with Government against demand for Free Education. A
tough, dialectical job, requiring skill, temper, courage. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>
displays each quality. Cool, collected, master of the situation, deftly
warding off thundering blows, and now and then changing, with swift
action, from defensive to offensive. A pretty sight, worth waiting a
week for.</p>
